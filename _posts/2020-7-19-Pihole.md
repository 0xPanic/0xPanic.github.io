title: Vulnerabilties in Pihole's setDNS function
---

tl;dr

cve-2020-12620: edit /etc/pihole/dnsserver.conf to append &&/tmp/reverseshell.sh to an ip address to get root shell

cve-2020-14162: ```sudo pihole -a setdns 1.1.1.1&&bash``` to get root shell (need to be able to run pihole with uid 0, ww-data can)

This started with me running `grep -R exec *.php` on the source code for AdminLTE to look for command injection vulnerabilities, which lead to me discovering this line of code

Going up the DU chain I didn't see any point where the $IP variable is sanitized, however the variable is the result of a file read of /etc/pihole/dnsserver.conf

this file is a list of semicolon separated IP addresses that can be selected to be the pihole's upstream DNS server. I tried appending a command to the end of an IP address to see what would happen. The only thing that I could get to wor k was appending &&/tmp/evil.sh to the end of an IP, where evil.sh is a reverse shell script.

The next time the config is saved with that IP selected, evil.sh will execute.

An obscure use case but a vulnerability nonetheless. This was patched on 5.0

What I didn't notice at first was that this really shouldn't have returned a root shell. I thought that the command being run was `sudo pihole -a setdns 1.1.1.1&&/tmp/evil.sh', which should return a shell as www-data. 

you can test this yourself by running sudo whoami&&whoami.

I didn't think too much of this though because at the time www-data could run any command with sudo without a password. However, they later restricted www-data to only be able to run `pihole` as root.

digging deeper it turns out that what is going on here is that the `setdns` command in pihole is setting an environment variable to be equal to the provided value, which is then sourced. The shell metacharacters in the environment variable's value is causing code to be executed. The command being run was actually `sudo pihole -a setdns "1.1.1.1&&/tmp/evil.sh"` and I just missed the quotation marks.

Which means that we can just run `sudo pihole -a setdns 1.1.1.1&&bash` from the command line and get a root shell if we have permission to run that command with sudo and nothing else.

This makes pihole <5.1 a GTFObin. While GTFObins aren't normally CVE worthy, www-data having permission to run this with sudo by default makes this a vulnerability.

This also means that the original exploitation method of editing the dnsserver.conf file is actually exploiting both CVEs in parallel (you could technically exploit cve-2020-12620 only by appending "/tmp/evil.sh instead, but there's not much of a reason to)
